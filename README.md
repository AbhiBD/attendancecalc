# Attendance Calculator

This project is an attendance calculator application that helps users track their attendance for various subjects. It allows users to input the subject name, total number of classes, and the required attendance percentage. The application then calculates the current attendance and determines the number of classes that need to be attended to meet the required attendance percentage.
